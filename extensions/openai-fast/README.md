# OpenAI Fast

This opt-in extension contributes a button immediately after the Composer's thinking control. It uses the host's confined `composerActions` and data APIs. The extension is enabled by default so the button is available; every Fast preference starts **off**.

## Scope and persistence

The preference is local to the opened project, session ID, provider and exact model ID. Its file is `.pi/agent/openai-fast/<session>_<encoded-provider>_<encoded-model>.json`; the adjacent `.status.json` contains only tier metadata. No prompt, response text, auth or account setting is stored. A missing or corrupt agent preference means off. UI read/write errors are dismissible.

Switching models/providers restores that exact pair's explicit preference. Closing/reopening or reconnecting the same project/session restores the saved preference. Before the host has assigned a session ID the control is off and disabled without reading/writing data; the first request starts off. New sessions and forks have new IDs and start off; choices do not inherit history. Selecting another project does not inherit them. UI writes need the host connection; an offline failure cannot claim a saved preference. The existing host sessionWorking signal (including observed activity, queued work and stopping), streaming, compaction and read-only leases disable the button. Writes pause polling synchronously, and write/refresh epochs reject late or out-of-order reads. Each provider request captures the choice before serialization; a concurrent external preference write applies to the next request, including the next tool-loop request, never the already-running request. Independent lane/worker requests do not inherit the foreground preference.

## Provider contract

The button appears for `openai-codex`, and for the explicitly listed Flapcode OpenAI identities in `shared/policy.js`. A mismatched API shows a disabled button with its reason. Unsupported tier errors are recorded and do not crash the extension or trigger a retry/model substitution; switch off before another user-requested attempt if necessary. The list is a request capability contract, not a promise of server support. New relay models must be deliberately added and tested.

On sends `service_tier: "priority"`; off sends `"default"` so account defaults or static sampling overrides cannot turn Fast on silently. Other providers/payloads remain untouched. Thinking effort and model names remain untouched. The final Pi `before_provider_request` hook survives `streamSimple` and reaches HTTP and Codex WebSocket serialization. No SDK fork or credential change is needed.

Pressed means **priority requested**. `effective` requires a terminal response reporting `priority` or `fast`; `standard` means the server reported `default` after a priority request; `unconfirmed` means no terminal tier was reported. Codex `response.done` is a terminal alias accepted by the pinned adapter and also confirms the reported tier. A created/in-progress event cannot confirm Fast. Unsupported is separate. An observation is tied to the preference revision, so an old result cannot confirm a changed choice.

The `message_end` replacement runs before session persistence and public listeners in the pinned Pi runtimes. It preserves actual tier metadata and recalculates catalog cost estimates from the reported tier: standard/default ×1, priority/fast ×2 (GPT-5.5 uses the pinned adapters' exceptional ×2.5 estimate), flex ×0.5. GPT-5.5 priority/Fast pricing is not currently verified against an official legacy tier table; persisted metadata explicitly uses `reported-tier-pinned-sdk-estimate-price-unverified` and the button tooltip identifies an unverified price. This retains the SDK's priority estimate and repairs its Fast-return estimate without presenting the result as verified billing. An absent/unknown tier leaves the SDK estimate unchanged and is marked unconfirmed; requested tier is never a price fallback. These are **catalog estimates**, not subscription credits or verified Flapcode charges. The relay probe performed by the separate research owner accepted `priority` but returned `default`; `fast` was rejected. Do not label those responses accelerated.

## Build and offline validation

The browser factory receives the host React instance and has no bare runtime React import. Its single-file bundle is checked in so existing source and runtime assembly routes can load it.

From this extension directory with the repository dependencies already present:

```sh
node scripts/build-app.mjs
node --test test/offline.test.mjs
```

To test the actual pinned SDK too, set `FAST_SDK_ROOT` to the repository's local node_modules directory and run the tests inside an OS sandbox that denies network. Tests use synthetic auth, fetch and WebSocket responses; they never read auth stores or call a real provider. UI tests live in the host workspace and cover the factory, confinement, model/session isolation and button placement. No additional live probes are part of this candidate.

## Host dependency and integration boundary

The agent requires Pi's final `before_provider_request` and raw `provider_stream_event` hooks plus `message_end` replacement before persistence. These were verified on the available `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`/`pi-ai` 1.0.0 runtime, including real offline AgentSession lifecycles. PipiUI's committed manifest still pins 0.84.2; its separately owned SDK upgrade WIP must be reviewed and integrated first, or the extension must remain unavailable. This feature changes no dependency manifests or lockfiles and does not claim a clean 0.84.2 rebuild was verified. The minimum requirement is the three hook contracts above; 1.0.0 is the verified version, not a claim that no earlier release supports them. A standalone copy onto PipiUI's committed base is not an accepted release.
