/**
 * Flapcode model catalog (single source).
 *
 * Flapcode is a Codex relay (Responses wire API, Bearer key). Model
 * parameters follow the upstream catalog and documented GPT-6 specs. The
 * transport here is plain `openai-responses` because the relay speaks the standard
 * Responses API with an API key, not the ChatGPT backend session protocol.
 */
/**
 * Established by live probing with a real key (2026-09): the documented
 * `codex.flapcode.com` gateway rejects every TLS handshake
 * (unrecognized_name); the working relay for the probed account is
 * `https://codex.takemoon.com/v1`, which the provider now pins. The
 * `flapcode.com/api/cli/config` lookup that used to resolve it per account is
 * gone: that control plane answers 409 "Codex account expired" for accounts that are
 * live and serving, so it could only steer a working provider off the relay.
 * The relay also requires
 * a `session-id` request header and `store:false` + `stream:true` +
 * structured list `input` in the Responses payload — pi's openai-responses
 * streamer already satisfies the payload side; the header is added by
 * provider.ts. `/v1/models` is not served (404), so the catalog is maintained
 * explicitly. Every listed model was relay-probed; GPT-6 Sol/Luna (2026-09-23)
 * answered at efforts none/xhigh/max, while their token/cost metadata comes
 * from OpenAI's model docs.
