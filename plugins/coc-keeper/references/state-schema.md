# COC State Schema

## Workspace

Runtime data lives under the current project `.coc/` directory:

```text
.coc/
├── rules/
├── investigators/
├── campaigns/
├── playtests/
├── indexes/
├── module-library/
└── exports/
```

Top-level indexes provide machine-readable entry points across the workspace:

```text
.coc/indexes/
├── investigators.json
├── campaigns.json
├── pdf-catalog.json
└── module-catalog.json
```

`investigators.json` records reusable investigator ids, display names, and paths to `creation.json`, `character.json`, `history.jsonl`, `development.jsonl`, and `inventory-history.jsonl`. `campaigns.json` records campaign ids, titles, status, play language, party file, and paths to each campaign's `save/`, `memory/`, and `logs/` folders. Campaign lifecycle `status` values describe only campaign saves; use `concluded` for a finished scenario, not `complete`, so save files and semantic requests do not read like Codex thread-goal completion signals.

## Reusable Investigators

Investigators are reusable assets:

```text
.coc/investigators/<investigator-id>/
├── creation.json
├── character.json
├── history.jsonl
├── development.jsonl
└── inventory-history.jsonl
```

`creation.json` preserves the original rulebook creation workflow and finance/skill allocation evidence. `character.json` is the reusable long-term sheet. Permanent changes are written to the investigator library only during explicit development, recovery, import, or campaign-ending workflows.

## Campaigns

Campaigns store temporary and scenario-specific state:

```text
.coc/campaigns/<campaign-id>/

`party.json` references reusable investigator ids. Campaign-specific HP, SAN, conditions, and scene position live under `save/`.

Subsystem session files (`combat.json`, `chase.json`, `sanity.json`) exist only
while their subsystem is active and are owned by the corresponding session
classes; do not hand-edit them mid-session. `pacing-state.json`,
`threat-state.json`, `npc-state.json`, and `storylet-ledger.json` are written
by the director apply layer each turn — treat `run_live_turn(...)` as their
single writer during live play.

`save/npc-state.json["psych"][npc_id]` is the canonical A20/A21 conversation
state. Its closed fields are `trust`, `fear`, `suspicion` (-5..5),
`known_facts`, `revealable_facts`, `lies_told`, `promises`, `lie_options`,
`deflect_options`, `deflections`, `leverage`, `active_reactions`, `availability`, and
`schedule`. Reads normalize malformed legacy values conservatively; that
normalization is not a repository-wide migration. Ordinary live turns may
change this state only through structured `npc_interactions` and typed
`npc_effects`. Free prose, skill names, agendas, and clue summaries are never
scanned to infer a tactic, target, or disclosure decision.

Social disclosure uses this exact order: NPC availability, fact knowledge,
fact revealability, active reaction, willingness (trust or authored leverage),
then reveal. A social clue is committed only when a matching decision is
`outcome=reveal`; lie/deflect outcomes may update NPC memory but never commit
the clue. Narrator envelopes expose a field-level public projection and omit
raw agendas, fact registries, lies, schedules, secrets, and internal agency.

Memory has two complementary tracks: `memory/session-summaries.jsonl` is the
append-only player-safe recap stream consumed by resume flows and battle
reports; `memory/cards/` + `context-packs/` + `index.json` is the retrievable
card store the Story Director queries (via `coc_memory`) for PAYOFF-style
recall. Session summaries are written at session boundaries; memory cards are
written by the apply layer when a plan carries memory_write intents.
`create_campaign` initializes the minimal resume contract: `world-state.json` tracks active scene, subsystem, clue ids, scene unlock/visit/history (`unlocked_scene_ids`, `visited_scene_ids`, `exhausted_scene_ids`, `scene_history`), decisions, memory refs, log refs, and investigator-state refs; `active-scene.json` stores the current player-safe scene pointer; `flags.json` stores clue, decision, spoiler-reveal flags, and a structured `flags` map (truthy keys feed `flag_set` exit/unlock conditions). `campaign.json` persists `play_language`, `language_profile`, and a `localized_terms` map keyed by language, so resumed campaigns keep the same visible narration language, output instruction, name policy, term policy, report labels, and name/term localization. Logs and memory may include `localized_text[play_language]` for player-visible prose that should be rendered directly before falling back to `localized_terms`.

`pending_choices` is Keeper-facing resume state, not a player menu. It may record
latent affordances, unresolved pressures, or rules choices for continuity, but
ordinary player-facing narration must translate those entries into diegetic
cues and an open-ended prompt instead of rendering them as numbered or bulleted
actions. Visible action lists belong only to meta discussion, setup/character
creation, explicit rules subsystems, or player-requested option summaries.
**禁止**将 `pending_choices` 存为玩家可见的选项字符串数组（如 `["问租客","查记录","进屋"]`）；
玩家可见的行动暗示必须来自编译后场景的 `affordances`（见 story-graph-schema），由 narrator 转成
diegetic cue，并由 `choice_frame.is_real_fork` 决定是否在真分叉时停下交选择。`pending_choices`
只承载 Keeper 续跑所需的状态连续性，绝不承载玩家菜单。

## Logs And Memory

- `logs/*.jsonl` is append-only event history.
- `logs/events.jsonl` stores story events, `logs/rolls.jsonl` stores mechanical roll events, and `logs/audit.jsonl` stores Keeper-facing audit events such as confirmed spoiler reveals.
- In fast recording mode, verbose JSONL writes are queued under `logs/pending-turns/` and flushed by a background recorder or maintenance pass; never poll or block narration on that flush.
- `memory/session-summaries.jsonl` stores player-safe running recaps for resume and battle reports; `memory/cards/` is the director-retrievable memory store (see Campaigns above for the split).
- `snapshots/` stores point-in-time recovery copies.

## Playtests

Playtest runs use `.coc/playtests/<run-id>/sandbox/` and must not mutate real campaigns or investigators. Promote sandbox artifacts only after explicit user request.
