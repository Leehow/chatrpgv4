/**
 * Verify the read-only Boss policy against the REAL Pi binary.
 *
 * The unit tests prove `main-tool-policy.ts` returns the right names. They cannot prove Pi
 * honors them, and they cannot see the failure this script exists for: a tool that registers
 * correctly but is never mentioned in the prompt, so the Boss is never told it has it.
 * `ledger_note` shipped that way once — enabled, callable, and invisible.
 *
 * Two sides, neither of them our argv-building code:
 *
 *   registered — every tool our own extensions actually register, collected by loading each
 *                extension with the env the real spawn sets, so env-gated registrations
 *                behave the same way.
 *   advertised — the system prompt the real Pi binary built from the real assembled argv.
 *
 * Requires a working `pi` on PATH and a configured provider. Deliberately not part of
 * `npm test`: it launches real processes and depends on the developer's Pi installation.
 *
 *   npm run check:boss-tools
 *
 * Node's own type transform, not tsx: an extension that imports `@earendil-works/pi-ai` at
 * runtime resolves only under ESM, and tsx loads these files as CommonJS, where that package's
 * export map has no `require` condition. Under tsx the three biggest extensions — including
 * the one registering `ledger_note` — silently fall into the "not covered" bucket.
 *
 * `--experimental-transform-types` rather than `--experimental-strip-types`: strip-only
 * refuses TypeScript parameter properties, which is a syntax two of our extensions use. That
 * refusal cost coverage rather than correctness — an extension the loader cannot open is one
 * whose tools this check never sees. `scripts/ts-specifier-resolve-hook.mjs` closes the other
 * half, where a source tree imports itself by the specifiers only `tsc` output satisfies.
