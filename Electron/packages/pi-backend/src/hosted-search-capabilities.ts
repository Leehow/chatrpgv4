/**
 * Canonical capability-enrichment seam for official built-in hosted-search providers.
 *
 * The bundled server-tools adapters in `packs/` inject
 * provider-native web search UNCONDITIONALLY for their exact provider+API pair
 * (`before_provider_request`), regardless of catalog capabilities:
 *
 *   pipiui-openai-server-tools.ts   provider === "openai"        api === "openai-responses"
 *   pipiui-codex-server-tools.ts    provider === "openai-codex"  api === "openai-codex-responses"
 *   pipiui-claude-server-tools.ts   provider is anthropic        api === "anthropic-messages"
 *   pipiui-gemini-server-tools.ts   provider === "google"        api === "google-generative-ai"
 *
 * Built-in official catalog rows (e.g. `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`) carry no
 * `capabilities`, so the capability-driven filters (main-session tool policy,
 * worker native-search runtime catalog) could not hide the local generic search
 * tools (`web_search`, `browser_search`, `browser_fetch`) and a hosted-web model
 * saw both search channels.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place in the host that matches provider ids / API
 * streamer ids for hosted-search capability purposes. Downstream filters stay
 * capability-only (`hostedTools` / `nativeSearch` bags) and never infer from
 * provider names. Matching here is EXACT — one wrong character is a near-miss
 * and stays unenriched (fuzzy relay providers keep generic search; the
 * adapters' own request-time defense still cleans those payloads on the wire).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in the table: providers whose hosted search is contributed
 * by an extension. Those adapters are capability-driven ("keys off catalog
 * capabilities — never a provider id and never a default search fallback"), and
 * their models get capabilities through extension contributions. An
 * `x_search`-only row is never enriched either — a lone `x_search` must keep
 * generic `web_search`.
 *
 * Declared/contributed capabilities always win: enrichment only FILLS rows that
 * declare no conflicting hosted search of their own, and is idempotent.
