 * it is the one piece nothing else can guard. PipiUI's core is small by construction — Pi's
 * runtime plus this file — and that only stays true while the base stays closed: a rule added
 * here cannot be toggled, scoped to a model, or replaced without a rebuild, which is exactly
 * what the philosophy layers exist to avoid.
 *
 * These tests are the lock. They pin delivery (it reaches every session, first), the content
 * (a digest, so amending it shows up in review as a deliberate edit), and the two properties
 * that make it safe to be unconditional: it names no tool, and it does not grow.
 *
 * See `resources/runtime/pi-core-prompt/README.md` for where a change belongs instead.
