/**
 * The agent definitions are the prompt a worker reads closest to its own decisions, so a tool
 * world enumerated here outranks the philosophy prefix in practice.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed: across seven workers in one session the split was 136 `grep` calls to
 * 11 `code_search`, with 31 of those greps (22%) returning nothing while `code_search` and
 * `find` returned nothing 0% of the time — and `repo_map` / `code_nav` / `read_spans` were
 * never called at all. The philosophy layer was being delivered the whole time. What these
 * prompts still said was that searching means `rg`, and that "three materially different
 * strategies" is satisfied by three keywords.
