# SL-29 — Two imported PDF modules: build, play 20 turns, triage

## Books (owner's copies)
- A: `/Users/haoli/Documents/TRPG/克苏鲁的呼唤/血色公路.pdf` (111 pages, 26 MB, zh-Hans).
- B: `/Users/haoli/Documents/TRPG/coc英文/Call of Cthulhu - Masks of Nyarlathotep (Larry DiTillio, Lynn Willis, Mike Mason etc.).pdf` (669 pages; `du` showed 0 B, so it may be an iCloud placeholder: read a page first to force the download and report the real size).

## Scope (one worker per book)
1. Import through the product path the App uses (find it in §20/§22 and the App/host code; the driver has a `--module` option for a registered module; the memory notes "pdf-campaign-create-was-impossible" and "reviewer-slip-kills-the-whole-book" describe past failure modes). Report the build's stages, wall time, model calls and cost markers as it goes; for B report after the first chapter and continue unless the build fails.
2. From the built module's own graph write a 20-turn player script in the book's play language (the scenes, people, obligations and checks the graph carries), one sentence a turn, branch rules by structural conditions only; pre-register class lines as `live-gate-long-preregistration.md` does.
3. Play it on the driver (hybrid-v1, PI_COC_JEV_PRESELECT=1) with the App's grok login; triage every finding by class (delivery, wall, routing, admission, binding, looks, prescreen, drops, fiction/rules, stalls) into a dated Comments entry with evidence paths; no fixes in this ticket.
