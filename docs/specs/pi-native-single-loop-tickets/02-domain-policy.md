# SL-02 — Migrate the domain policies; the plan is no longer the entry

Move table evidence (the prescreen), ordinary resolve/apply and the routing fan-out into the RunPolicy; make the plan an optional artifact; remove `submit_plan_packet` from the hybrid tool set; one tool catalog for the LLM and Jev; `infer(bind)` for open parameters.

## Depends on

- SL-01 accepted.

## Scope

- Candidates from real state only (kernel apply options with availability, scene assets, uninstroduced people under the capsule's label, Mod pending contacts, ordinary check with the closed binder, active-session families, located entities); no internal tags; consumed keys.
- Read first, re-read after a scene change; the prescreen allowance becomes the run's Jev budget.
- Jev's own tools (read more, locate, bind); the LLM fills open parameters when Jev chose the operation.
- `IntentBinding` required, `Requirements` and `PlanArtifact` optional; complex inputs get a `PlanArtifact` inside the run, never a second executor.

## Acceptance (design §13 SL-02 gate)

- A simple turn has no forced LLM plan; the turn-3 replay reproduces 8/8 live actions with ≤ 5 LLM steps against the product driver; special families still reach an LLM proposal path; every route distribution is in telemetry.
